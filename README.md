Milestone 1: Static Interactive Resume Builder
Create a static resume that includes sections for Personal Information (Name, Contact Details, Profile Picture), Education, Skills, and Work Experience. Use TypeScript to add basic interactivity, such as a button to toggle the visibility of the "Skills" section or other sections, enhancing user engagement.
